## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{python}
college_years = ['Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior']
print(list(enumerate(college_years, 2019)))


class Solution:
  def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return nums1 + nums2


print(Solution().intersect(nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]))
print(Solution().intersect(nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]))   
        
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [3, 4, 5]
print(l1 and l2)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
